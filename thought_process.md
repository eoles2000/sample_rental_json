# Thought Process: Creating the process_json_pandas.py Script

## Understanding the Requirements
- **Input Data**: The script needs to process JSON files containing rental data.
- **Validation**: Validate the JSON data against a predefined schema.
- **Data Storage**: Store the validated data in an in-memory SQLite database.
- **Querying**: Execute SQL queries to summarize the rental data.
- **Output**: Write the summarized data to disk and optionally display it.
- **Logging**: Implement logging for error tracking and debugging.

## Initial Steps
1. **Research Libraries**: 
    - Explore Python libraries suitable for handling JSON data, data validation, data storage, and logging.
    - Potential options for JSON parsing include `json`, `ijson`, and `orjson`.
2. **Outline Script Structure**: Build the basic structure of the script, including functions for loading JSON, validating data, database operations, and result display.

## Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: Data Loading and Validation
- Utilize the `pandas` library to load JSON data into a DataFrame.
- Define a schema using `pandera` to validate the DataFrame against predefined rules.
- Implement error handling for file not found or invalid JSON format.

### Phase 2: Database Operations
- Connect to an in-memory SQLite database using the `sqlite3` module.
- Write the validated DataFrame to an SQLite table.
- Define SQL queries to summarize rental data, including sessions, unreturned rentals, and missing starts.

### Phase 3: Result Display and Logging
- Display summarized data using tabulate and termcolor for formatting.
- Implement logging using the `logging` module to track script execution, errors, and debugging information.
- Write logs to a file for future reference.

### Phase 4: Command-Line Interface
- Use `argparse` to create a command-line interface for specifying JSON file paths and display preferences.
- Allow users to choose whether to display results to the console or not.

## Testing and Debugging
- Test the script with various JSON files, including valid and invalid data.
- Debug any issues encountered during testing, including schema validation errors, SQL query failures, or data formatting problems.

## Documentation and Readme
- Create a readme.md file explaining script setup, usage, and examples
- Create a considerations.md file 
- Include information about scheduling script execution, potential future improvements, and assumptions about JSON data.
